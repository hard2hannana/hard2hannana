## Portfolio Website

This repository contains my personal portfolio site, built to showcase my work, projects, and technical skill set. The site serves as a central place to present real-world projects, experiments, and ongoing learning across software development, infrastructure, and platform engineering.

It highlights:
- Selected projects with descriptions and links
- Practical implementations rather than toy examples
- A focus on clean structure, performance, and maintainability
- Iterative improvements as skills and tools evolve

This repo is actively maintained and reflects how I approach problem-solving, system design, and continuous learning in a real working environment.
